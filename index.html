            <p class="tab">Twitter has been used as a method of short and (sometimes not so) sweet communication since its inception in 2006. Over the last decade, coders have developed ways to mine this treasure trove of information, one of which being sentiment analysis. In light of the recent debates over America’s healthcare system, I chose to focus my Synthesis Two assignment on tracking sentiment regarding the two most prominent names in healthcare: TrumpCare and ObamaCare.</p>
</p>
            <p class="tab">In order to perform this analysis, I first had to create a sentiment analysis engine. By following along with a tutorial from PythonProgramming.net, I was able to learn how to stem, part of speech tag, and chunk with the NLTK for Python. Next, I learned how to recognize named entities and convert words into features, create word classifiers, use the SklearnClassifier, and use all of these tools to investigate bias in text. The tutorial also helped me create training data for my sentiment analysis engine based on the two hosted files containing positive and negative movie reviews. Those files are saved to my Github repo for reference.</p>
</p>
            <p class="tab">After finishing up the training data, my sentiment analysis engine was complete. I then moved to my test data: tweets. First, I needed to gain access to the Twitter Streaming API. After quickly setting up a developer’s account on the site, I was provided with the codes that granted me access to the stream. Once I created a StreamListener and specified my keywords (trumpcare and obamacare), I proceeded to save the sentiment of each of 1000 tweets collected for each mention to an output file. These files contained the words ‘pos’ or ‘neg’ for positive or negative, based on my code’s confidence in that sentiment being greater than 80%.</p>
</p>
            <p class="tab">The following outputs were built via these 2000 tweets, and it is easy to see that sentiment surrounding both TrumpCare and ObamaCare is extremely negative. This could be due to a few reasons. One, the confidence score that I specified in my analysis was relatively high. Perhaps by lowering it, I would be able to obtain a more varied result, i.e., more positive tweets. Additionally, the training set of movie reviews for my sentiment analysis engine may not have been the right choice. If I were to complete this analysis again in the future, I would probably train my engine on tweets themselves, as this would be a more accurate portrayal of what I was trying to test. Lastly, having two separate visualizations makes it difficult to draw conclusions when comparing the two. If I were to repeat this design, I would be sure to figure out how to encode both lines on the same graph in order to better show how they align.</p>
</p>        <p class="tab">Overall, I believe that I succeeded in showing what I intended to show: sentiment surrounding the systems of healthcare provision are extremely negative. The public is openly expressing its dissent, both via Twitter and via Congress itself, who recently decided to kill the TrumpCare plan before having a vote to pass the bill. Perhaps if I were to run my analysis again, I would find some more positive sentiment: celebration by the people!</p>
